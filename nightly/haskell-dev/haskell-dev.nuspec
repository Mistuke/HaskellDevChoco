        NOTE: This is a nightly build of the haskell-dev tool for Haskell intended for eco-system support.
        It is built from commit %build.commit.hash% from the git repository.
        No support is provided for these builds.  For supported versions see the 'haskell-dev' package.
        ```

        This is an opinionated automated environment for performing Haskell development on windows
        using GHC and Cabal along with MSYS2.  The goal of the project is to create as minimal of
        indirections between you and the tools as possible in order to simplify things and make
        things easier to understand and debug.  The core premise of the project is to integrate into
        Windows and not box off or isolate Haskell tools from other tools while using no or as few
        global state as possible.

        This package will automatically configure msys2 for use by cabal.  If you already have msys2
        install then nothing else needs to be done. Otherwise msys2 can be installed with `choco install msys2`.

        Lastly in order to facilitate package installations a new CmdLet `mingw64-pkg` is created to make it easier to install
        native dependencies such as `gtk`.

        For AppVeyor use we recommend installing the ghc and cabal packages directly.
